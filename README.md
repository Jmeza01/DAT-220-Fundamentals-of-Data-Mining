## Analysis in Machine Learning Principles of Business Problem

###Prior to the business channels, why has the sales flattened and diminished from the historical past of two years from the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company?
From the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company, I see it has faced difficulties within sales. Although, I have seen it spike up high in the historical past in sales when the famous name “Bubba Gump” was announced in the movie Forrest Gump and created a great contribution for customers’ interest to come close to the company’s product. Now, it seems that within the past years the company has struggled to make profit in revenue from sales. However, if the sales rate in making profit continues to flatten, then it will lead the company to bankruptcy or into a small business to be ranked throughout nationwide.
